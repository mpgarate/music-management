# Roon Export Tags

## Claude Instructions

In export_tags_to_playlists.py, there are two hard-coded xslx files in the script. Let's add cli arguments to provide them with --roon-tracks and --roon-albums.

When done, run the command with the files in this dir.

To test the script, we can run it using nix and the shell.nix file in this dir.
